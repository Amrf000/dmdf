Requirements:
(See "Modifying.txt" to read how to setup the project)
- The latest MPQ archive "TPoF.mpq"
- The checked out TPoF and ASL projects
- The JassNewGenPack with all requirements
- MPQDraft
- NSIS
- WinMerge or something similar

To release a new version of The Power of Fire several steps have to be done:
- Make sure the version number is bumped in all maps (in the map settings as well as in the interface strings for supply)
- Save all maps without the debug mode in the JNGP
- Merge the latest war3map.wts files from all maps into the German "war3map.wts" files in the folder "maps/MAPNAME".
- Merge the German "war3map.wts" files from the folder "maps/MAPNAME" into the English ones and translate all new German entries.
- Make a copy of every map for the English version of the map
- Replace the "war3map.wts" file in every English map by its latest English "war3map.wts" file from the folder "maps/MAPNAME".
- DOES NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT: Use Widgetizer or ultimate map SLK optimizer to optimize all maps loading time.
- Use the war3mapoptimizer to optimize all maps (English and German) and save the optimized map into a directory which you later set in the variable "INPUT_DIR". You need a subfolder "de" for the German version of the maps and a subfolder "en" for the English versions.
- Create the custom exe with the latest MPQ archive. Use MPQDraft to create this .exe file.
- Modify the file "Scripts/installer.nsi" and update the variables at the top of the file:
	!define INPUT_DIR "E:\Projekte\dmdf\maps\releases"
	!define INPUT_EXE_FILENAME "The Power of Fire.exe"
	!define INPUT_EXE "E:\Warcraft III\${INPUT_EXE_FILENAME}"
	!define VERSION "0.5"
- Run the application NSIS (available on the Internet) with the file "Scripts/installer.nsi".
- Now you have the finished setup in the folder "Scripts/". It should be called "The Power of Fire${VERSION}.exe". This file can be distributed and run by everyone who has Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.

Note: The script "Scripts/makereleasemaps.bat" creates optimized versions for all German maps and copies to replace the war3map.wts files in English maps.
