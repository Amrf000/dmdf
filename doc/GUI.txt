Advanced GUI systems use destructables and not trackables anymore to be shown in the current camera view on the map.
Even if trackables are still used in systems like "MUI" they could be dropped and only destructables could be used.

Those could be moved with the camera view and therefore more buttons could be inserted.

CreateDestructableZ(dt, x, y, 5, 0, 0.6, 0)
call SaveDestructableHandle(udg_FSS, 2409 + pl, i, d)
call ShowDestructable(d, false)

Use the replaceable ID to replace the model's texture and create a destructable for every ability or command which has to be in the GUI.

Since there is no selection event for destructables use a dummy unit for the selection event. The dummy unit needs a selection scale of 0.0 to
hide its health bar. It should be an invisbile model with the same size of the destructable.

Custom images cannot be used since they angle cannot be changed. You can only see them from the top.

To change the Destructibles to the view of the player use billboarded textures.
