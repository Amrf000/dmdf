Requirements:
- MPQ archive "TPoF.mpq"
- JassNewGenPack: http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/tools-560/jassnewgenpack-5d-227445/
- JassParser: http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=105235&highlight=JassParser

Since it is all Open Source you can change/improve the modification as you would like to. The following small tutorial shows you how to install all necessary files:

I've uploaded the custom MPQ archive "TPoF.mpq" at [url]http://wc3lib.org/dmdf/TPoF.mpq[/url].
You have to download it and place it for example in your Warcraft III folder.

The current maps can be found [url="http://gitweb.wc3lib.org/?p=dmdf.git;a=tree;f=maps]here[/url].

You would have to install and setup the [URL="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/tools-560/jassnewgenpack-5d-227445/"]JassNewGenPack[/URL] to load the MPQs.
Edit the file "loadmpqs.lua" and add the entry to the bottom of the file:
[CODE]
loadmpq(15, "E:\\Projekte\\TPoF.mpq")
[/CODE]

Replace the path with the path to your downloaded MPQ file.

Now you can start the JassNewGenPack World Editor and open one of the maps to change the terrain or the object data.

If you want to work with the scripts as well you must checkout the source code for the ASL and TPoF:
Use something like [url]http://www.heise.de/download/git.html[/url] to check both projects out.
Use the following URLs to check both projects out into two different folders.
[CODE]
git clone git://wc3lib.org/asl.git
git clone git://wc3lib.org/dmdf.git
[/CODE]

After that edit "jasshelper.conf" in your Warcraft III directory which comes from the JassNewGenPack and set:
[CODE]
[lookupfolders]
// Just type the folders where //! import would look for if relative paths where used, include the final \
// embed them in quotes
// example: "c:\"
// The order causes priority:
"C:\\YourDirectory\\asl\\src"
"C:\\YourDirectory\\dmdf\\src"

[externaltools]
// this is for //! external NAME args the syntax is "NAME","executable path"
// example:
//"OBJMERGE","c:\kool.exe"

//* 
//* grimextension pack by pitzermike:
//*
"FileImporter","grimext\FileImporter.exe"
"ObjectMerger","grimext\ObjectMerger.exe"
"PathMapper","grimext\PathMapper.exe"
"TileSetter","gimext\TileSetter.exe"
"ConstantMerger","grimext\ConstantMerger.exe"
"TriggerMerger","grimext\TriggerMerger.exe"
"FileExporter","grimext\\FileExporter.exe"
"PatchGenerator","grimext\\PatchGenerator.exe"

[wewarlock]
//put the path to WEWarlock between quotes
//Ex: "C:\WeWarlock-0.7.0\WarlockCompiler.exe"

[jasscompiler]
//this is to specify what compiler to use, normally pjass.exe,
// though you may also want to use JassParserCLI.exe ...
"JassParserCLI.exe"
// The next line specifies the jass syntax checker's arguments:
"--report-leaks --pjass $COMMONJ $BLIZZARDJ $WAR3MAPJ"
// i.e. You can change it to "$COMMONJ +rb $BLIZZARDJ -rb $WAR3MAPJ"
// in case of a recent  PJass version ...

[forcemethodevaluate]
[noimplicitthis] 
[/CODE]

JassParserCLI can be downloaded from wc3c.net: [url]http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=105235&highlight=JassParser[/url].
It has to be installed into the subdirectory "jasshelper" of the Warcraft III directory.

Finally you have to open the map in JassNewGenPack and to save it either in debug mode or without debug mode. To optimize the map you could use: [url]http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/tools-560/default-wc3mapoptimizer-5-0-a-251543/[/url]

If you cant run Warcraft loading the MPQ you can use [url]http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/tools-560/mpqdraft-v20060913-62893/[/url]
to create a custom Warcraft exe using the TPoF.mpq file.
