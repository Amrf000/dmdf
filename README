"Die Macht des Feuers" (engl. The Power of Fire) is a cooperative RPG multiplayer modification for Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.
All source code is under the GPLv3.

If cloning the repository takes too long, you can make a shallow clone or reduce the clone depth and not clone the whole history.
Since I have pushed the history of binary map and campaign files as well, the history became quite big.

The model, texture and sound resources are not part of this repository.

You need the Advanced Script Library to use this code. The ASL is the core of this modification's code.

Available boolean constants which have to be defined in a globals block:
DMDF_CREDITS enables credits (GUI)
DMDF_INFO_LOG enables talk log system (GUI)
DMDF_NPC_ROUTINES enables NPC routines
DMDF_VIOLENCE enables blood effects in fights
